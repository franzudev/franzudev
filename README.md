I am a surveyor turned Software Engineer turned Cloud Native Engineer.

I'll try to be primarily active in the Kubernetes ecosystem, opening issues and reviewing documentation, while I'm improving my Go skills to become an active contributor on the codebase.
Currently, my main focus is [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api), a declarative multi cluster management project. You can learn more about it on [cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/).
